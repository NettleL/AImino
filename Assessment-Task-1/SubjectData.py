{colr('COMMON TYPES OF ENERGY')}

    • {colr('Light Energy')}
    • {colr('Heat (Thermal) Energy')}
    • {colr('Electrical Energy')}

    • {colr('Potential Energy (PE)')} -  the energy stored in objects that is waiting to be used.
        • {colr('Elastic PE') }- the energy stored through the stretching or squashing of the physical shape of an object 
            E.g in a trampoline, the springs and the mat of the trampoline stretch under our weight and hold this as stored energy.
            The more the springs stretch, the more energy they hold.
            The energy is returned to our bodies when the springs and mat return to normal and we are thrown into the air. 
        • {colr('Gravitational PE')} -  the energy an object possesses because of its position in relation to the gravitational field.
            If we lift an object up, it gains gravitational potential energy (GPE).
            The larger the mass and the larger the height, the more GPE the object gains. 
        • Chemical PE - the energy stored within a chemical substance.
            Using chemical reactions to break the bonds holding the atoms together releases the energy.

    • {colr('Nuclear energy')} -  involves the splitting or joining of the centre (nuclei) of atoms to release (large) amounts of energy.
    • {colr('Kinetic Energy')} - The energy an object has due to its motion
    • {colr('Sound Energy')}

{colr('TRANSFORMING ENERGY')}
Energy transformation is the process of changing energy from one form to another.

E.g Battery in mobile phone transforms chemical energy into electrical energy
Chemical energy → electrical energy
	
{colr('TRANSFERRING ENERGY')}
Heat energy travels through materials in three different ways

{colr('1. Conduction')} (through solids)
    Heat transfer by conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between two objects in direct contact with each other.
{colr('2. Convection')} (through liquids + gases)
    In liquids and gases, thermal energy can also move by convection. Tiny circular currents, called convection currents, carry the thermal energy. A convection current is movement within a liquid or gas that is driven by differences in the thermal energy of the molecules.
{colr('3. Radiation')} (through space)
    Thermal radiation generates from the emission of electromagnetic waves. These waves carry the energy away from the emitting object.

{colr('INTERACTIONS IN A ECOSYSTEM')}

A {colr('biosphere')} is the living component of the Earth. It is made up of all the living organisms, and extends both into the atmosphere (birds and insects) and deep underground and to the bottom of the ocean (bacteria). It is broken up into ecosystems.

An {colr('ecosystem')} is made up of all the living organisms (biotic factors) and the physical, non-living conditions (abiotic factors) in a particular area and the interactions within and between the two. Ecosystems are made up of habitats

A {colr('habitat')} is a particular area where a group of different organisms live, and the area has similar abiotic conditions throughout (e.g. temperature, water availability, wind speed). 

All the individuals of a particular species living in the same habitat are called a {colr('population')} . 

All the populations of all the different organisms in that habitat are called the {colr('community')}

{colr('Food Chains and Food Webs')}
A {colr('food chain')} shows a list of organisms in the order of what eats what with an arrow between each organism to indicate the direction of the flow of energy. 

The sun is a source of energy. Autotrophic organisms (i.e producers) such as plants use photosynthesis to convert the energy in sunlight to sugar. Then heterotrophs (i.e consumers) such as animals consume other organisms to acquire energy. Detritivores and decomposers eat dead + decaying matter, breaking it down into chemicals which return to the soil, air and water to be absorbed by plants.
{colr('''
Producer  → First Order Consumer → Second Order Consumer → Third Order Consumer → Fourth Order Consumer''')}
             (Herbivore)	           (Carnivore)           (Top Order Predator)	   (Detritivores)
{colr('''|_________|  |__________________________________________________________________________________________|
Autotrophic				                           	Heterotrophic
''')}

Because most organisms will eat more than just one type of food, a species may be part of many food chains at the same time. These multiple food chains can be linked together in a {colr('food web')} to represent the feeding relationships between the different organisms in an ecosystem.

{colr('Effect of Human Activity on Food Webs')}

{colr('•')} Urbanisation + deforestation alters the amount of producers in an ecosystem - this will affect the number of types of herbivores, which in turn will affect the number and types of carnivores in the ecosystem.
{colr('•')} In ecosystems with many trees, a dense mat of plant roots stabilises the soil, and a layer of leaf litter covers the surface, which protects the soil from wind and water erosion. Remove these plants destabilises the soil. Plants filter water as it soaks into the soil, because the stems and leaves of grasses catch large particles of pollutants, and the plants themselves often remove toxins from the water that is absorbed into their roots. When these plants are cleared for human habitation or agriculture, these pollutants and toxins can get into the groundwater and can contaminate natural waterways. This is called land degradation.
{colr('•')} Introduced species - i.e organisms that are not native to an ecosystem but instead have been placed there by humans - upset the balance of an ecosystem because they alter the food web. An example is  the Northern Pacific Seastar, which was accidentally carried into Australian waters by ships from its native ecosystem in the northern Pacific Ocean, becoming a huge pest in Australian waters, as it has few natural predators. It outcompetes the native seastars and has become the dominant predator in some areas.


{colr('MICROORGANISMS')}
Microorganisms are living things that can only be seen with a microscope. 
    
    {colr('Types of microorganisms')}
    
{colr('Bacteria')}
Bacteria are from the kingdom Monera and are prokaryotic (i.e do not contain a true nucleus or membrane-bound organelles). They are up to 10 µm (micrometres) in length

Bacteria cells can be identified by the following characteristics
{colr('•')} very small size
{colr('•')} presence of a cell wall
{colr('•')} absence of a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles
{colr('•')} Some bacteria may have cilia (short hair like structures) and/or flagella (long tail-like structures) on the surface of the cells, which help with movement.

{colr('Protozoa')}
Protozoa are from the kingdom Protista and tend to be much larger than bacteria, up to one millimetre in length. They are eukaryotic organisms and as such have membrane-bound organelles and a true nucleus. 

Protozoa have
{colr('•')} An outer membrane called a pellicle which is more rigid than the inner cell membrane (instead of cell wall)
{colr('•')} May have cilia or flagella

{colr('Fungi')}
Fungi are eukaryotic (like protozoa), and so have a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles. However, fungi are unable to photosynthesise so they never contain chloroplasts. Fungi are heterotrophic, like animals. 

Fungi have 
{colr('•')} A cell wall made from a chemical called chitin
{colr('•')} Fungi do not require cilia or flagella for movement as they must grow on a surface


{colr('─────')} {bold('ECOSYSTEMS')} {colr('─────')}


{colr('FLOWERING PLANTS')}

{colr('The Root + Shoot System')}
Flowering plants have two organ systems in addition to their flowers: the {colr('shoot system')} and the {colr('root system')}. 
The shoot system consists of the {colr('stem, leaves, buds, flowers and fruits')}. The root system consists of either a {colr('branching or a fibrous system of roots')}.

The function of the root system is to {colr('anchor the plant to a surface and to absorb and transport water and minerals')}.

{colr('Photosynthesis + Respiration')}
Photosynthesis is the reaction used by plants to transform light energy into chemical energy. Photosynthesis needs the help of a chemical called chlorophyll, the green pigment in the chloroplasts of plant cells. Chloroplasts are found in cells in the shoot system, particularly in tissues near the surface of the leaves.
Photosynthesis can be summarised by the following word and symbol equations

{colr('Carbon dioxide + light energy + water + light→ glucose + oxygen light')}
6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

{colr('Mitosis')}
Cell division is the process by which a cell divides into two or more cells. Plants use a type of cell division called mitosis to repair and regenerate damaged plant tissues, etc.
In mitosis, a parent cell divides to produce two daughter cells with the same identical genetic instructions carried in their DNA. It is asexual reproduction, as if it creates offspring that are genetically identical to the parent.

{colr('ELEMENTS')}

{colr('Particle Model Of Matter')}

    {colr('•')} All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms that are too small to be seen, but have mass.
    {colr('•')} Atoms cannot be created or destroyed, and atoms are indivisible.
    {colr('•')} Particles are always moving. When it is hotter, particles move faster; when it is cooler, particles move slower. 
    {colr('•')} All atoms of the same element are identical, but are different from atoms of other elements
    {colr('•')} Atoms can join together to form larger particles called molecules When they combine, their masses add together
    {colr('•')} Different atoms can combine to form compounds 
    {colr('•')} Forces hold molecules and compounds together to stop them from separating.
    {colr('•')} Atoms follow these rules in all substances. 

{colr('Elements')}
Elements are substances made up of only {colr('one')} type of atom, and are often referred to as {colr('pure')} substances.
There are {colr('98')} different elements found naturally on the Earth. Another {colr('20')} atoms have been made artificially, but these are {colr('highly radioactive')} and are {colr('too large to be stable')}, and therefore they decay (break apart) almost as soon as they are made.

    {colr('Periodic Table')}
{colr('Periods')} - horizontal rows
{colr('Groupts')} - vertical columns
Elements in a group often have similar properties, such as the way they look or how they behave. 

Elements can be split up into {colr('metals, metalloids and nonmetals')}. 
Metals are found on the {colr('left-hand')} side of the periodic table, non-metals are on the {colr('right')} and a thin band of metalloids are {colr('in between')} the two. Metalloids are a small set of elements that show properties of both metals and non-metals.

+--------------------------------+--------------+------------ --------+

The structure of metals is a {colr('lattice of positive particles')} surrounded by a {colr('sea of free electrons')}. 
The atoms of a metal are arranged in a lattice. The positive nucleus and some electrons are attracted to each other, but metals also have some free electrons that are able to to move around the substance. This allows it to conduct electricity.

Non-metals vary greatly in their properties. Their electrons tend to be connected, either to other atoms or to each other, which is a key difference to metals. This means non metals cannot conduct electricity as their electrons are all used in connections rather than being free to wander.

Most nonmetals are gases at normal temperatures. Some gases, such as helium, neon and argon, are monatomic (each gas particle is a single atom) while others, such as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen,  are diatomic (the atoms of these elements join together in pairs). Some, like sulfur, are polyatomic (many of their atoms are joined together)

{colr('COMPOUNDS + MIXTURES')}

{colr('Compound')}
A compound is any substance made up of more than one type of atom or element that are chemically bonded or joined together in a fixed ratio

{colr('Types of compounds')}
    • {colr('Molecular')} - Molecular compounds form discrete (separate) units that are made up of a set number of atoms. (e.g water)
    • {colr('Polymer')} - The molecules in polymers are made of groups of atoms in a pattern that repeats over and over (e.g plastic)
    • {colr('Lattice')} - In a lattice, atoms are held together in three dimensional networks - usually between metals and non metals  (e.g NaCl)

{colr('Mixtures')}
Mixtures are not pure substances. They are substances made up of two or more different pure substances, elements and/or compounds that are not chemically bonded together. Remember that compounds are different elements chemically bonded or joined together. Mixtures are different from compounds

{colr('Homozygous vs Heterozygous.')}

A homogeneous mixture looks the same throughout the substance. Each type of particle in the mixture is distributed evenly throughout the substance.
Common homogeneous mixtures include air, milk, seawater, and chocolate cake. Solutions and alloys are homogeneous mixtures.

A heterogeneous mixture does not look the same throughout the substance. Sand is an example of a heterogeneous mixture

{colr('─────')} {bold('CHEMICAL CHANGE')} {colr('─────')}


{colr('PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES')}

{colr('Physical Changes')} - when a substance just changes in shape or appearance
In a physical change , the substance still consists of the same particles but the substance looks different before and after the change. The particles within a substance may rearranged themselves as atoms gain/lose energy, but the chemical bonds between the atom are not changed
{colr('Chemical Changes')} - when the change involves one substance changing into a different substance
In a chemical change, bonds are broken and formed to make new substances

{colr('Indicators of a chemical change')}
    {colr('•')} Gas is produced (note: alone it may just mean a change in state occurred (to gas)
        {colr('•')} bubbles or fizz, or can be smelled
    {colr('•')} Energy change
    {colr('•')} Light is produced
    {colr('•')} Heat is absorbed or produced
    {colr('•')} Permanent colour change occurs
    {colr('•')} Precipitate (insoluble solid substance) forms in the solution and does not disappear.
