MODULES

Recurrent Backbone module
- 3 layers of bidirectional GRU cells with lightweight hidden units
- Batch normalisation, dropout between layers, residual skip connections

Self Attention module
- Low Rank adaptation block after final GRU layer to integrate global context
- low self attention integration

Lightweight minitransformer with dropout on attention weights

Pairwise Projection Module
- simple outer product - converts sequential embeddings into pairwise features
- refinement - 1x1 convolution

Iterative Refinement Module

Output/Regression layer
- Includes differntiable MDS module with batch normalisation + dropout
