Git LFS must be installed on the machine before cloning the repo.

The actual file must be downloaded via: git lfs pull

Note
Preprocessing_training_data is not required for the program to function - it merely documents how the preprocessing of training data was executed so the program can be replicated

Preprocessing_user_input is not required for the program to function - it contains misc. pieces of code I previously thought were useful but later learned I did not need. However, I was reluctant to delete them - I thought they may be useful to the user.
