    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p> Proteins are macromolecules consisting of chains of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds (i.e polypeptide chains) and folded into a particular 3d structure, which is determined by the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chains. The structure of a protein influences its interactions with molecules and thus dictates the function of the protein. </p>
    <p> Proteins perform many critical functions in the human body - including acting as antibodies, enzymes and structural support. Understanding the structure of a protein provides greater insight into how the proteins works, and thus improves our ability to: </p>
    <p> • predict which molecules interact with the protein <br>
        • understand various biological interactions <br>
        • alter a protein's function <br>
        • assist in drug discovery <br>
        • design specific proteins <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        AImino predicts the 3d structure of a protein given its amino acid sequence.

    <h1> Use </h1>
    <p> Upload a FASTA file containing a single amino acid sequence (i.e. for one protein) using either the Upload button above or the page in the menu.
        The program will take a few minutes to process and predict protein structure.
        The predicted structure will then be displayed. The style of the 3d-plot can be changed using the radiobuttons beneath it.
